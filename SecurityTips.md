# Security Tips

If you want to improve your cybersecurity, these three tips will prevent a large amount of attacks. Once you have these tips in place, you can move on to more advanced techniques.

## 1. Keep Software Updated

When companies find out about security problems in their software, they release updates to fix those problems. Whenever security updates com out, you should update as soon as possible.

If you don't update your apps and devices, criminals can use the unfixed security problems to break into your device and steal your data.

## 2. Use Unique Passwords for All Accounts

If you use the same password for multiple websites, when your password is leaked in a data breach, criminals can login to all your accounts that use that leaked password.

If you use a unique password on each website, a leaked password will only let a criminal into one of your accounts: not all of them.

Don't worry, it doesn't need to be hard to remember all yoru unique passwords. **Password Managers** can remember your passwords for you and even generate strong passwords automatically.

To get started, you can use the password manager built into your browser. The password manager is the tool that asks if you want to save your password. If you want a more advanced password manager, I recommend [Bitwarden](./https://bitwarden.com/).

## 3. Turn on Multi-Factor Authentication

Turn on multi-factor authentication on any account that supports it.
